# Contributing to HTML Content Processor

We love your input! We want to make contributing to HTML Content Processor as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions focused and small

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests continue to pass
- Test both Node.js and browser environments
- Include edge cases in your tests

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Update API_USAGE_EXAMPLES.md for new features
- Add inline code comments for complex logic
- Keep examples simple and clear

## Bug Reports

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We actively welcome feature requests. Consider:

- The scope of the change
- Backward compatibility
- Performance implications
- Whether it fits the project's goals
